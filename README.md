# vidnight
Vidnight is a pinterest for youtube videos

This is similar to youtube's "playlist", but operates in a more pinterest like manner. That means, upon coming to the site, I see all of my video boards instead of a video list in the left nav. 

MVP Functionality:
- I can add or delete a board.
    (+++) When I create the board, ajax request sent to get first google image of specified board
- I can click on a board, which takes me to a list of all of my youtube video links
-   (+++) Alerts user to confirm if they would like to delete the board
- I can add or delete a youtube video link
- I see a list of all my youtube video links, all of which are clickable and opens a new window to play video
    (+++) Clicking on link plays video on page
- I can delete a youtube video link
(+++) Chrome extension to add videos to a board

(+++) means these are extra functionalities to build if I have time
